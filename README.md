# Linear Search in Java

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the **Linear Search** algorithm.

##  What is Linear Search?

Linear Search is a basic searching algorithm where we search an element **one by one** in an array, from start to end.  
If the element is found, its index is returned; otherwise, a "not found" message is displayed.

##  Key Points:

- No user input required
- Fixed array is used: `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`
- The element to be searched is: `30`
- Output shows the index of the found element

## Program Output:
Element found at index: 2
